A mysterious figure dubbed ‘Red Cap’ was stalking women on the streets then killing his prey, seemingly without provocation. His habit of striking at random made it impossible for the detectives to predict his next move. At the top of their minds is what could be triggering him. 

Aware of the American F.B.I. and its successful use of criminal profilers to identify serial killers, the head of the Criminal Behavioral Analysis team, Gook Young Soo recruits Song Ha Young, a quiet, reserved, incredibly perceptive former detective for his team. Gook believes using this new psychological method will give the police an edge in capturing 'Red Cap' and ending his killing spree. 

Homicide expert Yoon Tae Goo and her officers question the value of this approach and are resistant to entering such uncharted territory. To quell their scorn they need to convince that this radical crime-fighting approach will increase their arrest rates. Does Song Ha Young have the ability to gain the trust of callous criminals while seeing through them? Is he clever enough to outwit them?  But more importantly, does he possess the emotional fortitude to withstand the process?

Five years ago, Shen Yi, who was still a student, was sketching on the street. A man took a picture of a child and asked him to draw what the child would look like as an adult. However, this painting caused Haicheng detective Lei Yi Fei to be exposed as an undercover agent, and he was killed. And Lei Yi Fei happened to be Du Cheng's long-time friend and confidant. The strange thing is that, no matter how hard Shen Yi tried to recall for a few years, he couldn't draw the face of the man who asked him to paint the child's photo.

More importantly, the truth of Lei Yi Fei's death is still buried in Shen Yi's memory.

Working alongside Jung Woo, Officer Gong Hye Won refuses to let anything stand between her and what she wants.

Oshin,Japan ,297,8.2,362,"The 31st NHK Asadora Drama is Oshin. Oshin tells the story of a girl born in a very poor rural family in Japan, who through hard work and perseverance eventually triumphs over pain and adversity to achieve fame and success. Broadcast in the early 1980s when Japan had finally cast off the legacy of the post-war years and the Japanese were beginning to reap the benefits of economic development, the aim of the story was to recall the hardships the older generation had endured in order to pave the way for their children to enjoy their more affluent lifestyle. Viewers were drawn to the suffering of the main character Oshin - and then drew similarities between her story and their own home lives. 

Some Japanese worried that showing Oshin abroad would give the country a bad profile - and would even be shameful because it showed the seldom glimpsed, poor, unequal side of Japan. In the event, the reverse proved true. Oshin gave viewers outside Japan - whose only image of Japan was formed by Japanese cars or electric goods, or through bitter memories of Japanese treatment during World War II - a far better understanding of the modern Japan and its people.

I was sent to live again in the body of a high school teenager named Min, who was lying dead in the morgue in this hospital. In fact, living in a new body is no different to living in a homestay.

She is the one who makes me want to extend my stay in this body forever.

Who's the Keyman,China ,13,8.1,201,"This is said to be the sister adaption of the 'Who's The Murderer' series that He Jiong is cast in as well. 

Instead of solving cases where there is a dead body, cases of kidnapping or missing items, mysteries are to be solved in this show.  There will be a detective, a keyman (who can lie) and the rest are players, there might be some episodes where there is no detective so they will not have first round of voting. 

The sets for the keyman are very realistic as they are built for each episode and the cast goes through the story themselves. The props are very real and fitting for the set designs. In this aspect, it is very similar to the Who's The Murderer: Season 3  where the hotel of the first episode was built just for the show.

This show goes through the same format as 'Who's the murderer';
The case will start off like a story until some incident happens. All players will tell their alibis for their timelines. They will be split into groups to search for proof and evidence for 10 minutes. They will then head to the discussion room and explain or ask questions on the evidence that they have found. The detective will then make his/her first decision on who is the keyman. 

The show will carry on with all players finding evidence together and discovering more of the story as time passes. The detective will then have a one-on-one interrogation and sometimes will ask the players on who they suspect is the keyman. The search will carry on for a little while more before they do a group meeting on settling the final facts they know. 
The players are given time to have solo searches for additional evidence that they might have missed on before heading to make their decision on who the keyman is. The votes of all players are calculated and the player with most votes will be chosen as the keyman. 

The chosen player will then insert their key into the machine that reveals if they are indeed the keyman. If the machine lights up and turns on, the players have won and found the keyman. If the machine does not turn on, they have failed in finding the real keyman and he/she gets away with it.","Mystery,  Comedy ",Game Show Investigation Detective,"Violet He,  He Chen ",

They seem bound for totally different futures – the bookish Yu Xi Gu looks destined for academic success, while life is just a long popularity contest for Xiang Hao Ting. But a quirk of fate – and a crucial intervention by a female schoolmate – results in the two young men’s paths crossing. But there is more to both young men than first meets the eye. Xiang Hao Ting was not always this way. He started out as a perfect student until he discovered the joys of going off the rails. And Yu Xi Gu has a reason for being so aloof and studious: His parents died in a traffic accident while he was younger, and he is being fostered by his aunt. As such, he works hard to get good grades in an effort to win a scholarship and ease the financial burden on his relatives. Yu Xi Gu also works part-time at a convenience store, where his manager Liu Zhi Gang has developed a crush on a man he has met at the gym. Back at school, meanwhile, Yu Xi Gu and Xiang Hao Ting find themselves drawn together, and passions ignite. The former notices that he has the unique ability to bring Yu Xi Gu out of his shell – and becomes intent on melting his cold-as-ice exterior. What will happen when their two worlds collide? And can love be the catalyst that helps bring these two unlikely students together – as their high school days draw to a close?

Juuken Sentai Gekiranger,Japan ,49,7.9,405,"Four thousand years ago in China, a form of Kenpou martial arts called Juuken was developed. It was created by a man named Brusa Ee, who came to Japan and built the hidden village Juugenkyou. Juuken is a martial art in which one mimics the abilities of animals as well as trying to attain spiritual peace. However, dissent grew among the creator's ten students. Three of them believed that they should use the suffering and hatred harnessed within humans to increase their power, using their power to assume their monstrous forms; the Three Kenma. After Brusa Ee was murdered, the Kenma gathered followers to practice an evil form of the Juuken style known as Rin Juuken Akugata. The other seven students believed that true strength should come from within and engaged their former friends in a great war, ending the fight with a forbidden technique to seal the Kenma' powers at the cost of losing their own human forms in the process, becoming the Seven Kensei. Followers of the Kensei created the Geki Juuken Beast Arts school: the Juuken of justice whose sport discipline enhances the human body with the self-produced positive Qi called ""Geki"". It is taught by Grand Master Xia Fu, one of the Seven Kensei, using a sports goods company named ""SCRTC"" as a front. 

In the present time, a fallen student from the Geki Juuken school named Rio turns to the Rin Juuken style, rebuilding the Rinjuu Hall and brought the long-dead Rin Juuken users back to life as kyonshi to collect Rinki, Geki's polar opposite Qi, in order to resurrect the Three Kenma so that through them, he can become stronger. To fight the new Rinjuu Hall, Xia Fu had been training two youths: Ran Uzaki and Retu Fukami. Along with Jyan Kandou, a feral boy raised by tigers in the woods near Juugenkyou, the Gekiranger team is formed and later joined by two other Geki Juuken users, Gou Fukami, Retu's brother and master of the Geki Juu Wolf-Ken style, and Ken Hisatsu, a genius master of the Geki Juu Rhinoceros-Ken style, to save the world from the Akugata's ambitions. However, an even greater evil is using the two sides for its own agenda.

Kamen Rider Ryuki,Japan ,50,7.9,817,"Thirteen Card Decks were created for thirteen Kamen Riders. They make Contracts with monsters from the mysterious Mirror World, a parallel dimension opposite to our own in which only the Kamen Riders can exist. The Riders draw on their monsters' strength in exchange for feeding them the life force of the creatures they destroy. The creator of the Advent Cards has only one rule: that there can be only one Kamen Rider. The others must be killed, and the sole victor will be granted a single wish, which leads to a conflict known as the Rider War.
All over the city, innocent people are being mysteriously abducted, never to be seen again. During his investigations of these incidents, Shinji Kido – an intern at the online news service ORE Journal – discovers one of the Advent Card decks at an apartment where every reflective surface has been covered by the newspaper. He is soon sucked into the Mirror World, discovering the terrifying truth behind the disappearances: people are literally being pulled through mirrors by the monsters of the Mirror World so that they may feed. He is about to be killed by a powerful dragon named Dragredder when he is saved by Kamen Rider Knight: Ren Akiyama. Ren seeks to win the Rider War at all costs. He works with a young woman named Yui Kanzaki, who seeks her missing brother: the master of the Rider War, Shirou Kanzaki. Seeing Ren's strength, Shinji enters the Rider War, not for the prize, but so that he may protect innocent people from the threat of the Mirror World, and stop the senseless fighting between the Kamen Riders. With Dragredder as his Contract Monster, he becomes Kamen Rider Ryuki.

Despite his dad’s diminutive size, Wan Deuk considers him to be the greatest man he knows. Wan Deuk has all the makings of a troublemaker: he gets bad grades and comes from a poor, underprivileged family. But when it comes to fighting, he has never lost about. With no hopes, dreams, and nothing to offer, there’s only one thing in this world that Wan Deuk prays for—the day that he can get rid of his homeroom teacher, neighbor, and incessant meddler Dong Ju. Wan Deuk can’t seem to get away from him; stuck with the man all day at school and beckoned to him at all hours of the night at home. As he does any other day, Wan Deuk stops by the neighborhood church and prays desperately for God to kill Dong Ju.
Dong Ju is a one-of-a-kind high school educator whose pupils have cleverly nicknamed “Dung-Zoo.” He doesn’t feel the need to wake up sleeping students in study hall and only profanity seems to come out of his mouth.

Having Dong Ju barge in at night to drink with Wan Deuk’s father and uncle is nothing new for the poor boy.

Kamen Rider 555,Japan ,50,7.8,800,"The Smart Brain corporation, the world's most powerful corporation, is trying to take over the world using Orphnoch, the next stage in humanity's evolution, to covertly kill off the human population. In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gear (Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death.
The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the Ryuseiji, after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic modification.
A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonoda, one of the Ryuseiji. The Smart Brain begins targeting him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear.
However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill them, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well. Most of these ""renegade"" Orphnochs are either killed, remain neutral or begin siding with the Ryuseiji against the Smart Brain.
When the Tokyo police discover the Orphnoch are behind a series of bizarre murders, they begin operations to defeat the creatures, largely unaware of the various factions involved. They even begin performing experiments on captured Orphnoch in an attempt to find ways of destroying them, though this does not go well.
The Orphnoch King eventually awakens within a young boy named Teruo Suzuki, whom Naoya Kaido and Keitaro Kikuchi saved and befriended. Now, it is up to the holders of the Rider Gears to band together and fight for humanity's survival.

Love with Flaws,South Korea ,32,7.8,"10,868","This romantic comedy follows a woman who has an aversion to flower boys and a man who has an obsession with appearance. 

The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.  The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.” 

In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.  

Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws. Throughout the drama they learn to see beyond appearances to the tragic backstories and scars that motivate themselves and the people around them.

When Reiko tells Kageyama about the case involving the discovery of Matsushita Keizan’s burnt body, Kageyama takes Reiko to the Hosho family’s art storage and while showing her Matsushita’s collection, he informs Reiko that he suspects that it is a locked room mystery situation. Reiko makes fun of Kageyama for having the same opinion as Kazamatsuri. Kageyama, with his damaged pride for being at the same level as Kazamatsuri, swearing that he will figure out the mystery, asks Reiko for more details of the crime.

This incident had in fact occurred on a trip to Okinawa that Detective Kazamatsuri had arranged.

This horrific news has sent a young man working in a dead-end office job named Masumi Nishina into shock. But he soon makes peace with his destiny and decides to return to his college library, where he intends to read books in a tranquil setting while he waits for the end to come.

But this decision proves to be a major mistake – as it is here he is reunited with the man who ruthlessly broke his heart: Ritsu Kusakabe. Back in college, they were both in the same publishing club but parted ways bitterly.
